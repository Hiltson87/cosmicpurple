Alacritty - Paste into ~/.config/alacritty - the only change is window opacity, otherwise it's the same as the default config
Bashtop - Paste into ~/.config/bashtop/user_themes
Cava - Paste into ~/.config/cava

I'll release the GTK/Gnome shell themes at a later date, currently don't feel they're ready to share.

Outside of that, most theming seen in the screenshots is from Pywal or forks from it. Pywal, Pywalfox, Pywal plugin for VS Code, etc.

The included wallpaper is not my original art and I do not intend to imply otherwise. It's a t-shirt design from Sloppy Pistons. I simply expanded the black background on it to both 16:9 and 21:9 formats.
